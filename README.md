# About the Task
### ALU Regex Data Extraction  

#### The Task  
We need to pull out specific types of data from a huge pile of text responses we get from our API. To do this, we’re going to use the power of ** Regex**. We already know how the data we’re looking for shows up in the text, so now it’s just about writing the right Regex patterns to grab it.  

Our API collects data from all over the web and shows users the info they’re looking for. Here’s the list of data we need to extract from tons of text:  

- **mail**  
- **URLs**  
- **Phone numbers**  
- **Credit card numbers**  
- **Time**   
- **HTML tags**  
- **Hashtags**  
- **Currency amounts**  

This is all about finding the right patterns in the text and pulling out what we need. Let’s get to it!
